title:  "Lattice Coding &amp; Crypto Meeting"

Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are indispensable mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on *18 January 2017* — is aimed at connecting the two communities in the UK with a common interest in lattices, with a long-term goal of building a synergy of the two fields. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format that will hopefully encourage interaction.

## Registration ##

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. Speakers are told the audience is somewhat familiar with lattices.
2. Please send us an email at <c.ling@imperial.ac.uk>, so that the size
   of the room fits with the number of participants.
