Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are indispensable mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on *29 September 2017* — is aimed at connecting the two communities in the UK with a common interest in lattices, with a long-term goal of building a synergy of the two fields. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format that will hopefully encourage interaction.

### <span>10:30 - 12:00 | Rachel Player:</span> TBD ###

### <span>13:00 - 14:30 | Ram Zamir:</span> Lattices in Information Theory ###

A lattice is a discrete subgroup of the Euclidean N-dimensional space, which is closed under regular addition and reflection.

Lattices provide useful analytical and algorithmic tools for designing codes for digital communication. In particular, lattice codes are used for analog-to-digital conversion, a problem known also as "vector quantization" or "lossy source coding". In the dual "channel coding" problem, lattice codes combine coding and modulation for noise immunity in transmitting digital data over the additive white-Gaussian noise channel. More recently, lattice codes were found useful for multi-user communication, in setups such as coding with side information, interference cancellation, network coding, and more.

What is a good lattice? how do we know it exists? how can we construct it? The figure of merit depends, in fact, on the application. In the talk we shall assess lattice goodness for each of the communication problems above, and show the existence of asymptotically good lattices as the dimension N becomes large. We prove the existence result in two ways: first, indirectly, using the Minkowski-Hlawka theorem; second, by randomizing a linear-code based lattice construction ("construction A").

## Registration ##

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. Speakers are told the audience is somewhat familiar with lattices.
2. Please send us an email at <c.ling@imperial.ac.uk>, so that the size of the room fits with the
   number of participants.
