Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are indispensable mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on *15 January 2018* — is aimed at connecting the two communities in the UK with a common interest in lattices. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format aimed at encouraging interaction.

In this talk we will discuss some of the practical aspects of lattice-based and homomorphic encryption, with particular reference to associated hardware designs. Current instantiations of FHE are known to be too slow for practical use. However, the combination of both algorithmic and implementation optimisations can increase performance greatly; for example we have shown research speed improvements for FHE encryption of up to approximately 130. Lattice-based cryptography shows promise as a quantum- safe alternative to existing public-key cryptosystems. However, the performance of such schemes suffer with associated large public key sizes, which is a challenge for real world systems. Research carried out into the hardware design of encryption using standard lattices, as part of the H2020 SAFEcrypto project, will be discussed to show the potential performance improvement achieved via the proposal of optimised hardware designs; our hardware design of a standard lattice-based cryptographic scheme carries out over 1200 encryptions per second and 4300 decryptions per second, targeting the lightweight Spartan-6 FPGA platform.

The learning with errors (LWE) problem has received a large amount attention since its inception in 2005 as a proposed quantum hard problem. Ring-LWE and Module-LWE have been proposed in order to significantly increase the efficiency of schemes at the potential cost of a stronger hardness assumption.

Standard results suggest that Ring-LWE is a more structured (and therefore potentially easier) problem compared to Module-LWE. However, in this talk, we present an explicit reduction from Module-LWE to Ring-LWE. More importantly, the consequences of this reduction will be discussed. In particular, the reduction suggests that the hardness of Ring-LWE increases with growing modulus which agrees with observations from state-of-the-art cryptanalysis. In addition, we conclude that the Module-LWE/Ring-LWE distinction is rather artificial with respect to hardness and that there is no trivial hardness hierarchy between the two problems. In addition, a Ring-LWE self-reduction that halves the ring dimension at the cost of squaring the modulus will be discussed.

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. Speakers are told the audience is somewhat familiar with lattices.
2. Please send us an email at <c.ling@imperial.ac.uk>, so that the size of the room fits with the
   number of participants.
