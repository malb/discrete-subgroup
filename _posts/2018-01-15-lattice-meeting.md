Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are indispensable mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on *15 January 2018* — is aimed at connecting the two communities in the UK with a common interest in lattices. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format aimed at encouraging interaction.

The learning with errors (LWE) problem has received a large amount attention since its inception in 2005 as a proposed quantum hard problem. Ring-LWE and Module-LWE have been proposed in order to significantly increase the efficiency of schemes at the potential cost of a stronger hardness assumption.

Standard results suggest that Ring-LWE is a more structured (and therefore potentially easier) problem compared to Module-LWE. However, in this talk, we present an explicit reduction from Module-LWE to Ring-LWE. More importantly, the consequences of this reduction will be discussed. In particular, the reduction suggests that the hardness of Ring-LWE increases with growing modulus which agrees with observations from state-of-the-art cryptanalysis. In addition, we conclude that the Module-LWE/Ring-LWE distinction is rather artificial with respect to hardness and that there is no trivial hardness hierarchy between the two problems. In addition, a Ring-LWE self-reduction that halves the ring dimension at the cost of squaring the modulus will be discussed.

## Registration ##

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. Speakers are told the audience is somewhat familiar with lattices.
2. Please send us an email at <c.ling@imperial.ac.uk>, so that the size of the room fits with the
   number of participants.
