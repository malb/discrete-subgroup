Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are useful mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on *24 September 2018* — is aimed at connecting the two communities with a common interest in lattices. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format aimed at encouraging interaction.

## Program ##

### <span> 10:30 - 12:00 | [Leo Ducas](https://homepages.cwi.nl/~ducas/)</span>:  ###

### <span> 13:00 - 14:30 | [Krzysztof Latuszynski](http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/statistics/staff/academic-research/latuszynski/)</span>: Markov chain Monte Carlo: design and optimisation ###

This talk will present Markov chain Monte Carlo, its motivation in statistics and its probabilistic underpinning. Design and properties of the popular MCMC algorithms, such as the Metropolis-Hastings, the Gibbs sampler, MALA and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo will be presented and their optimisation that underlines the design of adaptive MCMC methods will be discussed.

### <span> 15:00 - 16:30 | [TBC]()</span>:  ###

### <span> 16:45 - 18:15 | [Laura Luzzi](http://perso-etis.ensea.fr/luzzi/)</span>: Algebraic reduction for low-complexity lattice decoding ###

High-performance lattice codes for wireless and multiple antenna channels can be designed using number fields and division algebras. However, the main drawback of algebraic lattice codes is their prohibitive decoding complexity under maximum likelihood decoding. Algebraic reduction is a special lattice reduction technique which exploits the additional multiplicative structure of these codes to allow for low-complexity decoding. More precisely, this technique consists in absorbing part of the channel into the code, by approximating the channel matrix with an element of the group of units of the ring of integers in the number field, or of the group of units of the maximal order in the division algebra. This talk will revisit previous work on algebraic reduction and discuss the advantages and challenges of this technique as well as some recent applications.

## Registration ##

Everyone is welcome. Two caveats:

1. Speakers are told the audience is somewhat familiar with lattices.
2. Please send us an email at <conghui.li15@imperial.ac.uk>, so that the size of the room fits with the number of participants.
