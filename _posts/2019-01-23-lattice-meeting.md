title:  "Lattice Coding &amp; Crypto Meeting"

Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are useful mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on Wednesday *23 January 2019* — is aimed at connecting the two communities with a common interest in lattices. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format aimed at encouraging interaction.

### <span> 10:30 - 12:00 | [Fernando Virdia](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/fernando-virdia(4ad6e099-9f70-4a5d-b0ac-cc37dd176547).html)</span>: Implementing RLWE-based Schemes Using an RSA Co-Processor ###

The transition to quantum-resistant cryptography will require designing, implementing, certifying and deploying new hardware capable of accelerating post-quantum cryptographic schemes. Given how slow this process can be, we look at the possibility of repurposing currently existing RSA/ECC co-processors for accelerating (ideal) lattice-based cryptography by exploiting the availability of fast long integer multiplication. Such co-processors are deployed in smart cards in passports and identity cards, secured microcontrollers and hardware security modules (HSM). In particular, we demonstrate an implementation of a variant of the Module-LWE-based Kyber Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) that is tailored for high performance on a commercially available smart card chip (SLE 78).
