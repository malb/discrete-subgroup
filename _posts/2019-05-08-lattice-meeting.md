Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are useful mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on Wednesday *8 May 2019* — is aimed at connecting the two communities with a common interest in lattices. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format aimed at encouraging interaction.

High-Performance Parallel Architectures]() ###

In recent years, several hard problems from lattice theory have become popular for constructing post-quantum PKC. Besides post-quantum cryptography, lattice-problems have been used to construct homomorphic encryption schemes. Homomorphic encryption has applications in privacy-preserving cloud computing: users can upload their encrypted data in the cloud and can still perform computation on the encrypted data. While in theory, lattice-based cryptography offers wide applicability and strong security, its real deployment in a wide range of computing devices faces several challenges.

I will talk about the challenges in computing polynomial arithmetic in a ring and the computational and architectural solutions to overcome these challenges. I will describe how our post-quantum PKC scheme SABER, which is a candidate in the ongoing NIST’s post-quantum standardization event, was constructed to achieve both strong security guarantee and efficiency. I will conclude my talk by presenting a methodology for designing high-performance parallel architectures for homomorphic computing on encrypted data in the cloud.
