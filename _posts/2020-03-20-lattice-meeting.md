Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are useful mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on Wednesday *20 March 2020* — is aimed at connecting the two communities with a common interest in lattices. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format aimed at encouraging interaction.

## Programme ##

### <span> 11:00 - 12:00 | [Cen Jung Tjhai]()</span>: [Decoding of Goppa codes]() ###

### <span> 13:0:00 - 14:30 | [Maximilien Gadouleau]()</span>: [Introduction to rank metric codes]() ###

Rank metric codes are codes on matrices, where the distance is the so-called rank metric (the rank of the difference between two matrices). These codes  have notably been proposed in several post-quantum, code-based, cryptosystems. In this talk, we will review some of the main properties and results on those codes, including: how they can be viewed as codes on matrices or on vectors, the class of optimal Gabidulin codes and maximum rank-distance (MRD) codes in general, their proposed applications to data storage and network coding, and the use of skew-polynomial rings. We will also indicate which areas of that theory are still under development.

### <span> 14:45 - 16:15| [Jean-Pierre Tillich]()</span>: [Cryptography based on rank metric codes]() ###

### <span> 16:30 - 18:00 | [Christophe Petit]()</span>: [Post-Quantum Cryptography Based on Supersingular Isogeny Problems?]() ###

The security of many cryptographic protocols in use today relies on the computational hardness of mathematical problems such as integer factorization. These problems can be solved using quantum computers, and therefore most of our security infrastructures will become completely insecure once quantum computers are built. Post-quantum cryptography aims at developing security protocols that will remain secure even after quantum computers are built. The biggest security agencies in the world including GCHQ and the NSA have recommended a move towards post-quantum protocols, and the new generation of cryptographic standards will aim at post-quantum security. In this talk I will discuss isogeny-based cryptography, a particular family of protocols that are considered for post-quantum security. Isogeny-based protocols have appealing properties including the shortest key sizes among post-quantum cryptography candidates, practical constructions for key exchange and signature, and a clear mathematical elegance.
