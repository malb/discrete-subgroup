Lattice-based approaches are emerging as a common theme in modern cryptography and coding theory. In communications, they are useful mathematical tools to construct powerful error-correction codes achieving the capacity of wireless channels. In cryptography, they are used to building lattice-based schemes with provable security, better asymptotic efficiency, resilience against quantum attacks and new functionalities such as fully homomorphic encryption.

This meeting — on Friday, 11 December 2020 — is aimed at connecting the two communities with a common interest in lattices. It will consist of several talks on related topics, with a format aimed at encouraging interaction.

### <span> 12:30 - 13:30 | [Frederique Oggier](http://www1.spms.ntu.edu.sg/~frederique/)</span>: [A Quadratic Form Approach to Construction A of Lattices over Cyclic Algebras]() ###

### <span> 14:00 - 15:00 | [Algebraically Structured LWE, Revisited]()</span>: [Chris Peikert](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~cpeikert/) ###

In recent years, there has been a proliferation of algebraically structured Learning With Errors (LWE) variants, including Ring-LWE, Module-LWE, Polynomial-LWE, Order-LWE, and Middle-Product LWE, and a web of reductions to support their hardness, both among these problems themselves and from related worst-case problems on structured lattices. However, these reductions are often difficult to interpret and use, due to the complexity of their parameters and analysis, and most especially their (frequently large) blowup and distortion of the error distributions.

In this paper we unify and simplify this line of work. First, we give a general framework that encompasses all proposed LWE variants (over commutative base rings), and in particular unifies all prior "algebraic" LWE variants defined over number fields. We then use this framework to give much simpler, more general, and tighter reductions from Ring-LWE to other algebraic LWE variants, including Module-LWE, Order-LWE, and Middle-Product LWE. In particular, all of our reductions have easy-to-analyze and frequently small error expansion; in some cases they even leave the error unchanged. A main message of our work is that it is straightforward to use the hardness of the original Ring-LWE problem as a foundation for the hardness of all other algebraic LWE problems defined over number fields, via simple and rather tight reductions.
